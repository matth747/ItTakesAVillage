# It Takes a Village

## Description

As a citizen who cares about their community, I want a website so that community members in need may request material goods and another community member may fulfill this need. 

Given a CMS-style request and donation site, when I visit the site for the first time then I am presented with a homepage, which includes existing requests with descriptions from community members; navigation links for making a request; fulfilling requests and the option to log in.   
When I click on any other links in the navigation then I am prompted to either sign up or sign in.   
When I choose to sign up then I am prompted to create a username and password.  
When I click on the sign-up button then my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site.  
When I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in then I am prompted to enter my username and password.  
When I am signed in to the site then I see navigation links to fulfill requests, make a request, and the option to log out.  
When I click on the fulfill requests option in the navigation then I am presented with existing requests that include the request title, description and the date needed (if applicable).  
When I click on view request then I am presented with the title, description and date an individual request is needed by.   
When I click fulfill request then I am sent back to the fulfill requests page, the item I confirmed to fulfill is no longer there and an email is sent confirming my commitment to donate and any further instructions.   
When my request is fulfilled then an email is sent to me advising my request is being fulfilled and any further instructions.  
When I click on the make a request link then I am presented with a form to input the title of what I am in need of, a brief description and the date the item is needed by.   
When I click complete request then the newly created request is added to the fulfill requests page.   
When I click on the logout option in the navigation then I am signed out of the site.   
When I am idle on the site for more than a set time then I am able to view requests but I am prompted to log in again before I can add or commit to fulfilling a request.
